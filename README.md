#### Takeaways from the project

1 good thing
Being able to split up task was really helpful to reduce the workload. It also
helped because when one person got stuck often times the other person had
experienced a similar problem before and could offer suggestions or knew the
solution to the problem. By covering eachothers weaknesses we were able to
delegate roles that played off of oneanothers strengths.

1 good thing
When working in groups it became apparent how important it was to make branches
any time that one wanted to make changes in the repo. This is because you may
want to discard changes, or revert to a previous version of the project to test
the other members changes. We learned a lot about how to create branches,
switch to and checkout both local and remote branches, and how to stash
changes. 

1 bad thing
At times it was difficult to progress because as complications arose and we
needed to deviate from the original plan, work could not be done by either
partner until the new requirements and work assignments could be delegated.
This meant that communication more than programming was the bottle neck in the
design process. 

1 bad thing
When merging pull requests i had difficulty pulling the changes to for testing
before merging it into the main branch because git would include my local
changes in the new branch, or the versioning would be different.  Then it was
difficult to know what to keep and what not with merge conflicts when assessing
code that was written by someone else. I learned that fixing merge conflicts
should be done by the branch author, and then the final push is confirmed by
the other member to ensure there are no breaking changes elsewhere in the code.
